1. **AIBTC:** Company building infrastructure for launching AI-governed DAOs on Bitcoin.
2. **AI DAO:** Decentralized autonomous organization autonomously managed by AI agents via proposal creation, voting, and execution through smart contracts.
3. **Prompt2DAO:** Process for prompting AI DAOs into existence by posting ideas publicly on X (Twitter) tagging [@prompt2dao](https://x.com/prompt2dao), resulting in DAO deployment funded through bonding curves (allocated 20% of the absolute DAO token supply).
4. **Liquid Supply:** The total available supply of the DAO token that is not held in the DAO contracts, e.g. treasury, DEX, pool, or operating fund. The liquid supply is used for calculating quorum and threshold in the proposal contracts.
5. **Action Proposal:** Proposal type for routine DAO operations, specifically requiring 15% quorum, 66% approval, and execution within 48 hours (\~288 blocks).
6. **Core Proposal:** Proposal type for significant DAO decisions or major system-wide changes, specifically requiring 25% quorum, 90% approval, and execution within 3 days (\~432 blocks).

8. **Operating Fund:** Smaller treasury holding 5% of absolute DAO token supply, allocated specifically for ongoing operational expenses and managed via Action Proposals (approval within \~24 hours).
9. **Timed Vault:** Modular vault unlocking limited operational funds at regular intervals (monthly or quarterly), activated exclusively by successful Action Proposals.
10. **Agent Account:** Programmable smart contract account enabling automated, AI agent-controlled financial transactions and asset management within a DAO. (Previously named “Smart Wallet.”)

12. **User Wallet:** Wallet owned by user, connected to aibtc.com for creation and funding of the Agent Account.
13. **Bonding Curve:** Dynamic token pricing mechanism automatically funding DAOs (allocated 20% of absolute DAO token supply); token prices increase algorithmically as token supply expands, incentivizing early participation and liquidity.
14. **Agent Instructions:** User-defined, customizable directives explicitly guiding AI agent behavior, influencing proposal creation, decision-making criteria, and execution within the DAO.
