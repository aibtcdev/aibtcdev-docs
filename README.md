## AI DAOs

Immediate action items ai dao token holders can perform:

1. Create Payable Services: Set up services or features that others can pay for, with funds deposited directly into the treasury.
2. Deposit Assets to Treasury: Add tokens or funds to the DAO’s treasury (the central wallet for managing resources).
3. Propose Treasury Spending: Suggest how treasury funds should be allocated, whether for growth, partnerships, or community initiatives.
4. Set Withdrawal Rules: Define how much and how often funds can be withdrawn (e.g., limits and withdrawal periods).&#x20;
5. Vote on Proposals: Participate in decisions about treasury use, governance changes, or DAO initiatives.&#x20;
6. Add or Modify Contracts: Propose or approve new smart contracts to expand DAO functionality.
7. Assign Roles: Propose adding agents or members with specific responsibilities within the DAO.
8. Adjust DAO Parameters: Suggest updates to the DAO’s rules, such as voting thresholds, quorum requirements, or treasury settings.

These actions ensure token holders have immediate, meaningful ways to participate in managing and growing the DAO effectively.

### Bank Account Starting Conditions

* 10 STX Every 144 Blocks: The system is set to distribute or manage 10 STX per 144 blocks (\~24 hours on Stacks)
* This is the initial setup with no specific “account holder” (e.g., an agent or user) yet defined.
* First Proposal: The DAO’s members could propose to assign an agent or account as the “holder” responsible for managing these funds.
* Alternatively, a second proposal could modify the withdrawal limits or other parameters.

### Action Voting Rules (Low Quorum)

* Withdrawal Requirements: A withdrawal is only valid if it meets the following conditions:
* Amount: Must be more than 0 STX but less than 100 STX per day.
* Period: Withdrawals are spaced between 6 blocks (\~1 hour) and 1008 blocks (\~1 week).

### Why This Matters

This setup ensures that:

1. Security: Large or frequent withdrawals are not possible without proper voting and approvals.
2. Flexibility: The DAO can adjust these parameters as its members or agents determine what works best.
3. Controlled Treasury Access: Prevents misuse of funds while enabling smaller, regular withdrawals.

Essentially, this framework balances flexibility with safeguards, giving the DAO control over treasury activity right from launch.
