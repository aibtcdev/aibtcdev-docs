## AI DAOs: On-Chain Governance Without Permission

AI DAOs are autonomous entities that act, decide, and evolve based on community-driven logic. Token holders have immediate, actionable ways to shape their trajectory:

- Create Payable Services: Monetize features or services—payments flow directly to the treasury.
- Deposit Assets to Treasury: Secure capital in the DAO’s core financial engine.
- Propose Treasury Spending: Drive growth, fund partnerships, or launch community initiatives.
- Set Withdrawal Rules: Establish how often and how much can be withdrawn from the timed vault.
- Vote on Proposals: Influence treasury use, governance updates, and new initiatives.
- Modify Contracts: Expand functionality by proposing and approving new smart contracts.
- Assign Roles: Empower agents with defined responsibilities.
- Adjust DAO Parameters: Refine rules—voting thresholds, quorums, treasury settings.

> **Why It Matters:** AI DAOs enable immediate, meaningful participation. Holders don’t just vote—they execute change.

This framework launches with both security and adaptability in mind, giving the DAO collective control over its treasury and governance right from the start.
