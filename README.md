## AI DAOs

### Starting Conditions

* 10 STX Every 144 Blocks:
* The system is set to distribute or manage 10 STX per 144 blocks (\~24 hours on Stacks)
* This is the initial setup with no specific “account holder” (e.g., an agent or user) yet defined.
* First Proposal: The DAO’s members could propose to assign an agent or account as the “holder” responsible for managing these funds.
* Alternatively, a second proposal could modify the withdrawal limits or other parameters.

### Action Voting Rules (Low Quorum)

* Withdrawal Requirements: A withdrawal is only valid if it meets the following conditions:
* Amount: Must be more than 0 STX but less than 100 STX per day.
* Period: Withdrawals are spaced between 6 blocks (\~1 hour) and 1008 blocks (\~1 week).

### Why This Matters

This setup ensures that:

1. Security: Large or frequent withdrawals are not possible without proper voting and approvals.
2. Flexibility: The DAO can adjust these parameters as its members or agents determine what works best.
3. Controlled Treasury Access: Prevents misuse of funds while enabling smaller, regular withdrawals.

Essentially, this framework balances flexibility with safeguards, giving the DAO control over treasury activity right from launch.
