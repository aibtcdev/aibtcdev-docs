# AI Agent Crews

Imagine having a team of AI assistants, each specialized in different aspects of blockchain operations, ready to help you explore, analyze, and interact with the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchain.

Here's what makes AI Agent Crew special:

1. **Interactive AI Agents**: We've created various AI "crews" that can perform different tasks related to blockchain analysis and interaction.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: You don't need to be a coding expert to use AI Agent Crew. We've built a simple, [web-based interface](https://run.aibtc.dev) using Streamlit that makes it easy to interact with our AI agents.
3. **Blockchain Integration**: Our AI agents can perform real actions on the Stacks blockchain, like analyzing smart contracts, summarizing wallet activities, or sending transactions.

Here are some cool things you can do:

* **Analyze Smart Contracts**: Ask our AI to break down and explain Clarity smart contracts.
* **Summarize Wallet Activities**: Get an AI-generated summary of a wallet's transactions and holdings.
* **Generate Clarity Code**: Need help writing a smart contract? Our AI can help draft Clarity code based on your requirements.

And we're always working on adding more capabilities!
