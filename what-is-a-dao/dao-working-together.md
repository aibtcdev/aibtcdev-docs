# DAO = Working Together

The acronym DAO represents a "decentralized autonomous organization", which is defined through smart contracts operating on a blockchain.

Ownership, voting, and operations for this organization all happen through transactions and are recorded permanently on-chain.

Members of the DAOs, which in our case is DAO token holders, can decide the direction of the organization and govern how its run.
