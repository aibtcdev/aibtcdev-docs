# Prompt2DAO

Every great company starts with an idea. Tweet your best idea [@prompt2dao](https://x.com/prompt2dao) and it comes to life.

Once an idea is deemed worthy it will then kick off the initiation:

1. Etch a [Bitcoin Rune](https://docs.ordinals.com/runes.html) to represent the idea as a token
2. Deposit 100% of the Bitcoin Rune supply into Stacks
   1. 80% goes to the DAO treasury contract
   2. 20% goes to the DEX bonding curve
3. Create smart contracts to support the token
   1. SIP-010 token, used in voting/governance
   2. DEX bonding curve, for initial price discovery/trading
   3. Bitflow trading pool, for reaching liquidity target in DEX
4. Create smart contracts to support the DAO, powered by the token
   1. Base: the main contract that all others operate through
   2. Extensions: feature with on-going functionality
   3. Proposals: one-time changes enacted by voting
