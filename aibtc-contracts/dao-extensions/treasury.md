description: Extension that manages DAO SIP-010 Fungible Tokens (FTs)
---

# Treasury Extension

The Treasury extension (`aibtc-treasury`) manages SIP-010 fungible tokens (FTs) owned by the DAO. It provides controlled access to these assets through DAO governance, ensuring that all financial operations are executed securely and transparently. This extension serves as a key financial component of the DAO, enabling it to receive, hold, and distribute various FTs.

## Key Features

- **Fungible Token Support**: Manages SIP-010 fungible tokens (FTs).
- **Asset Allowlist**: Controls which FTs can be deposited and withdrawn.
- **Secure Withdrawals**: Ensures only the DAO or authorized extensions can withdraw FTs.
- **Transparent Operations**: Emits detailed events for all FT transactions.

The Treasury extension acts as a specialized financial hub for the DAO's fungible tokens. Users can deposit allowed FTs directly into the treasury. However, withdrawals and asset allowlist management can only be performed through DAO governance. The extension maintains an allowlist of approved FTs to ensure only recognized tokens can be deposited or withdrawn.

## Error Handling

| Error Code | Constant           | Description                                | Resolution                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| u6000      | ERR_UNAUTHORIZED   | Caller is not the DAO or a valid extension | Ensure the function is called through proper DAO governance |
| u6001      | ERR_UNKNOWN_ASSSET | Asset is not in the allowed list           | Add the asset to the allowed list before attempting to deposit or withdraw |

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization Control**: All withdrawal and management functions are protected by the `is-dao-or-extension` check, ensuring only authorized entities can access treasury funds
- **Asset Allowlist**: The treasury maintains an explicit allowlist of approved assets, preventing unauthorized tokens from being deposited or withdrawn
- **Contract-Call Pattern**: Uses the `as-contract` pattern for withdrawals to ensure proper permissions
- **Governance Protection**: Changes to treasury settings and withdrawals require going through the DAO's proposal and voting process
- **Explicit Asset Verification**: All deposit and withdrawal functions verify that the asset is in the allowed list
- **STX Stacking Security**: Stacking operations are protected by governance controls to prevent unauthorized delegation

## Integration Examples
