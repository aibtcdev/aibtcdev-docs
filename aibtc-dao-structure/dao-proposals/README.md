# DAO Proposals

## DAO Proposals

The DAO is governed entirely by token holders through a proposal system. Proposals come in two main categories: Action Proposals for predefined operations with lower thresholds, and Core Proposals for arbitrary changes with higher thresholds.

### Overview

All proposals follow a similar lifecycle:

1. Creation - A token holder creates a proposal
2. Voting Period - Token holders cast votes for/against
3. Conclusion - After voting ends, anyone can conclude the proposal
4. Execution - If passed, the proposal automatically executes

### Proposal Types

#### Action Proposals

Action proposals are predefined operations that can be executed with lower voting requirements. These are used for routine operations within set parameters.

**Voting Parameters:**

* 66% approval threshold
* 15% quorum requirement
* 1-day voting delay
* 2-day voting period

#### Core Proposals

Core proposals can execute arbitrary Clarity code and make fundamental changes to the DAO. They require higher consensus due to their power.

**Voting Parameters:**

* 90% approval threshold
* 25% quorum requirement
* 3-day voting delay
* 3-day voting period
